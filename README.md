[This is a take on the throbber](https://c1.goote.ch/49a5167773ee46cb9e9f9ac5d5363fd9.scene/) found on old [Netscape browsers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netscape_Navigator). [The original throbber can be found here](https://media.giphy.com/media/anjRJ4nv9WJzO/giphy.gif).

This was also my first time using the [Goo Engine and Creator](https://create.goocreate.com).

Since Goo Create's free plan no longer allows the export of scenes and bundles, only the assets are offered here.
